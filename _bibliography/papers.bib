  abstract={We propose an alignment-free, end-to-end Non-Audible Murmur (NAM)-to-Speech conversion model. Existing methods rely on large NAM-text pairs per speaker to generate high-quality alignments for training non-autoregressive models. However, alignment quality deteriorates when trained on multi-speaker data, limiting their ability to generalize and effectively utilize the available training data. To address this, we introduce a streamlined autoregressive approach that eliminates the need for explicit alignment learning. By leveraging multi-speaker samples, synthetic training pairs, and multitask character recognition training, our method reduces the word error rate (WER) by 59.19% compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) on two public datasets. We demonstrate the model’s zero-shot capability and validate the effectiveness of multitask training through ablation studies.}

  abstract={We consider the problem of single-source domain generalization. Existing methods typically rely on extensive augmentations to synthetically cover diverse domains during training. However, they struggle with semantic shifts (e.g., background and viewpoint changes), as they often learn global features instead of local concepts that tend to be domain invariant. To address this gap, we propose an approach that compels models to leverage such local concepts during prediction. Given no suitable dataset with per-class concepts and localization maps exists, we first develop a novel pipeline to generate annotations by exploiting the rich features of diffusion and large-language models. Our next innovation is TIDE, a novel training scheme with a concept saliency alignment loss that ensures model focus on the right per-concept regions and a local concept contrastive loss that promotes learning domain-invariant concept representations. This not only gives a robust model but also can be visually interpreted using the predicted concept saliency maps. Given these maps at test time, our final contribution is a new correction algorithm that uses the corresponding local concept representations to iteratively refine the prediction until it aligns with prototypical concept representations that we store at the end of model training. We evaluate our approach extensively on four standard DG benchmark datasets and substantially outperform the current state-ofthe-art (12% improvement on average) while also demonstrating that our predictions can be visually interpreted}

  abstract={A fundamental aspect of compositional reasoning in a video is associating people and their actions across time. Recent years have seen great progress in general-purpose vision or video models and a move towards long-video understanding. While exciting, we take a step back and ask: are current models good at compositional reasoning on short videos? To this end, we introduce VELOCITI, a benchmark to study Video-LLMs by disentangling and assessing the comprehension of agents, actions, and their associations across multiple events. We adopt the Video-Language Entailment setup and propose StrictVLE that requires correct classification (rather than ranking) of the positive and negative caption. We evaluate several models and observe that even the best, LLaVA-OneVision (44.5%) and Gemini-1.5-Pro (49.3%), are far from human accuracy at 93.0%. Results show that action understanding lags behind agents, and negative captions created using entities appearing in the video perform worse than those obtained from pure text manipulation. We also present challenges with ClassicVLE and multiple-choice (MC) evaluation, strengthening our preference for StrictVLE. Finally, we validate that our benchmark requires visual inputs of multiple frames making it ideal to study video-language compositional reasoning.}

  abstract={To understand a prompt, Vision-Language models (VLMs) must perceive the image, comprehend the text, and build associations within and across both modalities. For instance, given an ’image of a red toy car’, the model should associate this image to phrases like ’car’, ’red toy’, ’red object’, etc. Feng and Steinhardt propose the Binding ID mechanism in LLMs, suggesting that the entity and its corresponding attribute tokens share a Binding ID vector in the model activations. We investigate this for image-text binding in VLMs using a synthetic dataset and task that requires models to associate 3D objects in an image with their descriptions in the text. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs assign a distinct Binding ID to an object’s image tokens and its textual references, enabling in-context association.}

  abstract={We motivate weakly supervised learning as an effective learning paradigm for problems where curating perfectly annotated datasets is expensive and may require domain expertise such as fine-grained classification. We focus on Partial Label Learning (PLL), a weakly-supervised learning paradigm where each training instance is paired with a set of candidate labels (partial label), one of which is the true label. Noisy PLL (NPLL) relaxes this constraint by allowing some partial labels to not contain the true label, enhancing the practicality of the problem. Our work centres on NPLL and presents a framework that initially assigns pseudo-labels to images by exploiting the noisy partial labels through a weighted nearest neighbour algorithm. These pseudo-label and image pairs are then used to train a deep neural network classifier with label smoothing. The classifier’s features and predictions are subsequently employed to refine and enhance the accuracy of pseudo-labels. We perform thorough experiments on seven datasets and compare against nine NPLL and PLL methods. We achieve state-of-the-art results in all studied settings from the prior literature, obtaining substantial gains in the simulated fine-grained benchmarks. Further, we show the promising generalisation capability of our framework in realistic, fine-grained, crowd-sourced datasets.}

To address this, we introduce IdentifyMe, a new benchmark for mention resolution presented in a multiple-choice question (MCQ) format, commonly used for evaluating LLMs. IdentifyMe features long narratives and employs heuristics to exclude easily identifiable mentions, creating a more challenging task. The benchmark also consists of a curated mixture of different mention types and corresponding entities, allowing for a fine-grained analysis of model performance. We evaluate both closed- and open source LLMs on IdentifyMe and observe a significant performance gap (20-30%) between the state-of-the-art sub-10B open models vs. closed ones. We observe that pronominal mentions, which have limited surface information, are typically much harder for models to resolve than nominal mentions. Additionally, we find that LLMs often confuse entities when their mentions overlap in nested structures. The highest-scoring model, GPT-4o, achieves 81.9% accuracy, highlighting the strong referential capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs while also indicating room for further improvement.}

Applying loss directly over ground truth mel-spectrograms entangles speech content with MRI noise, resulting in poor intelligibility. We introduce a novel approach that adapts the multi-modal self-supervised AV-HuBERT model for text prediction from rtMRI and incorporates a new flow-based duration predictor for speaker-specific alignment. The predicted text and durations are then used by a speech decoder to synthesize aligned speech in any novel voice. We conduct thorough experiments on two datasets and demonstrate our method's generalization ability to unseen speakers. Our method achieves a 15.18% Word Error Rate (WER) on the USC-TIMIT MRI corpus, marking a huge improvement over the current state-of-the-art.}

However, the simulated speech often lacks intelligibility and fails to generalize well across different speakers. To address this issue, we focus on learning phoneme-level alignments from paired whispers and text and employ a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system to synthesize the ground-truth. To reduce dependence on whispers, we learn phoneme alignments directly from NAMs, though the quality is constrained by the available training data. To further mitigate reliance on NAM/whisper data for ground-truth simulation, we propose incorporating the lip modality to infer speech and introduce a novel diffusion-based method that leverages recent advancements in lip-to-speech technology. Additionally, we release the MultiNAM dataset with over 7.96 hours of paired NAM, whisper, video, and text data from two speakers and benchmark all methods on this dataset.}

Traditional methods, which rely on phoneme sequence manipulation, are often cumbersome and error-prone. To address this, we propose Prompt-to-Correct, an editing-based methodology for pronunciation correction in TTS systems using voice prompts. Our approach enables ac- curate, granular corrections at test-time without the need for additional training or fine-tuning. Unlike existing speech edit- ing methods, we eliminate the need for external alignment to determine edit boundaries. By simply providing a correctly- pronounced reading of a word in any voice or accent, our system successfully corrects mispronunciations while maintaining continuity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional baselines and state-of-the-art speech editing techniques.}

From the static camera feed, EditIQ  initially generates multiple virtual feeds, emulating a team of cameramen. These virtual camera shots termed rushes are subsequently assembled using an automated editing algorithm, whose objective is to present the viewer with the most vivid scene content. To understand key scene elements and guide the editing process, we employ a two-pronged approach: (1) a large language model (LLM)-based dialogue understanding module to analyze conversational flow, coupled with (2) visual saliency prediction to identify meaningful scene elements and camera shots therefrom. We then formulate cinematic video editing as an energy minimization problem over shot selection, where cinematic constraints determine shot choices, transitions, and continuity. EditIQ  synthesizes an aesthetically and visually compelling representation of the original narrative while maintaining cinematic coherence and a smooth viewing experience. Efficacy of EditIQ  against competing baselines is demonstrated via a psychophysical study involving twenty participants on the BBC Old School dataset plus eleven theatre performance videos.

The novelty of our framework lies in the overall design, simulation of the ground-truth speech, and a sequence-to-sequence translation network, which works in the latent space. We present comprehensive experiments on the existing CSTR NAM TIMIT Plus corpus and our proposed StethoText: a large-scale synchronized database of non-audible murmur and text for speech research. Our results show that StethoSpeech provides natural-sounding and intelligible speech, significantly outperforming existing methods on several quantitative and qualitative metrics.

Prior work has identified annotation differences, especially for mention detection, as one of the main reasons for the generalization gap and proposed using additional annotated target domain data. Rather than relying on this additional annotation, we propose an alternative formulation of the CR task, Major Entity Identification (MEI), where we: (a) assume the target entities to be specified in the input, and (b) limit the task to only the frequent entities. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MEI models generalize well across domains on multiple datasets with supervised models and LLM-based few-shot prompting. Additionally, the MEI task fits the classification framework, which enables the use of classification-based metrics that are more robust than the current CR metrics. Finally, MEI is also of practical use as it allows a user to search for all mentions of a particular entity or a group of entities of interest}

Fine-grained classification can be challenging, mainly due to the requirement of knowledge or domain expertise for accurate annotation.

To this end, we present a novel approach for Post-Hoc Correction called Hierarchical Ensembles (HiE) that utilizes label hierarchy to improve the performance of fine-grained classification at test-time using the coarse-grained predictions. By only requiring the parents of leaf nodes, our method significantly reduces avg. mistake severity while improving top-1 accuracy on the iNaturalist-19 and tieredImageNet-H datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art on both benchmarks. We also investigate the efficacy of our approach in the semi-supervised setting. Our approach brings notable gains in top-1 accuracy while significantly decreasing the severity of mistakes as training data decreases for the fine-grained classes. The simplicity and post-hoc nature of HiE render it practical to be used with any off-the-shelf trained model to improve its predictions further.}

With thorough experimental studies, we show that the proposed method improves over the prior art in accurately emulating the desired emotions while retaining the naturalness of speech. We extend the traditional evaluation of using individual sentences for a more complete evaluation of HCI systems. We present a novel experimental setup by replacing an actor with a TTS system in offline and live conversations. The emotion to be rendered is either predicted or manually assigned.

To solve RIS efficiently, we need to understand each word's relationship with other words, each region in the image to other regions, and cross-modal alignment between linguistic and visual domains. Recent methods model these three types of interactions sequentially. We argue that such a modular approach limits these methods' performance, and joint simultaneous reasoning can help resolve ambiguities. To this end, we propose a Joint Reasoning (JRM) module and a novel Cross-Modal Multi-Level Fusion (CMMLF) module for tackling this task. JRM effectively models the referent's multi-modal context by jointly reasoning over visual and linguistic modalities (performing word-word, image region-region, word-region interactions in a single module). CMMLF module further refines the segmentation masks by exchanging contextual information across visual hierarchy through linguistic features acting as a bridge. We present thorough ablation studies and validate our approach's performance on four benchmark datasets, and show that the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on all four datasets by significant margins.}

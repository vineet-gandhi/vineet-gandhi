  abstract={We propose an alignment-free, end-to-end Non-Audible Murmur (NAM)-to-Speech conversion model. Existing methods rely on large NAM-text pairs per speaker to generate high-quality alignments for training non-autoregressive models. However, alignment quality deteriorates when trained on multi-speaker data, limiting their ability to generalize and effectively utilize the available training data. To address this, we introduce a streamlined autoregressive approach that eliminates the need for explicit alignment learning. By leveraging multi-speaker samples, synthetic training pairs, and multitask character recognition training, our method reduces the word error rate (WER) by 59.19% compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) on two public datasets. We demonstrate the model’s zero-shot capability and validate the effectiveness of multitask training through ablation studies.}

  abstract={We consider the problem of single-source domain generalization. Existing methods typically rely on extensive augmentations to synthetically cover diverse domains during training. However, they struggle with semantic shifts (e.g., background and viewpoint changes), as they often learn global features instead of local concepts that tend to be domain invariant. To address this gap, we propose an approach that compels models to leverage such local concepts during prediction. Given no suitable dataset with per-class concepts and localization maps exists, we first develop a novel pipeline to generate annotations by exploiting the rich features of diffusion and large-language models. Our next innovation is TIDE, a novel training scheme with a concept saliency alignment loss that ensures model focus on the right per-concept regions and a local concept contrastive loss that promotes learning domain-invariant concept representations. This not only gives a robust model but also can be visually interpreted using the predicted concept saliency maps. Given these maps at test time, our final contribution is a new correction algorithm that uses the corresponding local concept representations to iteratively refine the prediction until it aligns with prototypical concept representations that we store at the end of model training. We evaluate our approach extensively on four standard DG benchmark datasets and substantially outperform the current state-ofthe-art (12% improvement on average) while also demonstrating that our predictions can be visually interpreted}

  abstract={A fundamental aspect of compositional reasoning in a video is associating people and their actions across time. Recent years have seen great progress in general-purpose vision or video models and a move towards long-video understanding. While exciting, we take a step back and ask: are current models good at compositional reasoning on short videos? To this end, we introduce VELOCITI, a benchmark to study Video-LLMs by disentangling and assessing the comprehension of agents, actions, and their associations across multiple events. We adopt the Video-Language Entailment setup and propose StrictVLE that requires correct classification (rather than ranking) of the positive and negative caption. We evaluate several models and observe that even the best, LLaVA-OneVision (44.5%) and Gemini-1.5-Pro (49.3%), are far from human accuracy at 93.0%. Results show that action understanding lags behind agents, and negative captions created using entities appearing in the video perform worse than those obtained from pure text manipulation. We also present challenges with ClassicVLE and multiple-choice (MC) evaluation, strengthening our preference for StrictVLE. Finally, we validate that our benchmark requires visual inputs of multiple frames making it ideal to study video-language compositional reasoning.}

  abstract={To understand a prompt, Vision-Language models (VLMs) must perceive the image, comprehend the text, and build associations within and across both modalities. For instance, given an ’image of a red toy car’, the model should associate this image to phrases like ’car’, ’red toy’, ’red object’, etc. Feng and Steinhardt propose the Binding ID mechanism in LLMs, suggesting that the entity and its corresponding attribute tokens share a Binding ID vector in the model activations. We investigate this for image-text binding in VLMs using a synthetic dataset and task that requires models to associate 3D objects in an image with their descriptions in the text. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs assign a distinct Binding ID to an object’s image tokens and its textual references, enabling in-context association.}

  abstract={We motivate weakly supervised learning as an effective learning paradigm for problems where curating perfectly annotated datasets is expensive and may require domain expertise such as fine-grained classification. We focus on Partial Label Learning (PLL), a weakly-supervised learning paradigm where each training instance is paired with a set of candidate labels (partial label), one of which is the true label. Noisy PLL (NPLL) relaxes this constraint by allowing some partial labels to not contain the true label, enhancing the practicality of the problem. Our work centres on NPLL and presents a framework that initially assigns pseudo-labels to images by exploiting the noisy partial labels through a weighted nearest neighbour algorithm. These pseudo-label and image pairs are then used to train a deep neural network classifier with label smoothing. The classifier’s features and predictions are subsequently employed to refine and enhance the accuracy of pseudo-labels. We perform thorough experiments on seven datasets and compare against nine NPLL and PLL methods. We achieve state-of-the-art results in all studied settings from the prior literature, obtaining substantial gains in the simulated fine-grained benchmarks. Further, we show the promising generalisation capability of our framework in realistic, fine-grained, crowd-sourced datasets.}

To address this, we introduce IdentifyMe, a new benchmark for mention resolution presented in a multiple-choice question (MCQ) format, commonly used for evaluating LLMs. IdentifyMe features long narratives and employs heuristics to exclude easily identifiable mentions, creating a more challenging task. The benchmark also consists of a curated mixture of different mention types and corresponding entities, allowing for a fine-grained analysis of model performance. We evaluate both closed- and open source LLMs on IdentifyMe and observe a significant performance gap (20-30%) between the state-of-the-art sub-10B open models vs. closed ones. We observe that pronominal mentions, which have limited surface information, are typically much harder for models to resolve than nominal mentions. Additionally, we find that LLMs often confuse entities when their mentions overlap in nested structures. The highest-scoring model, GPT-4o, achieves 81.9% accuracy, highlighting the strong referential capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs while also indicating room for further improvement.}

Applying loss directly over ground truth mel-spectrograms entangles speech content with MRI noise, resulting in poor intelligibility. We introduce a novel approach that adapts the multi-modal self-supervised AV-HuBERT model for text prediction from rtMRI and incorporates a new flow-based duration predictor for speaker-specific alignment. The predicted text and durations are then used by a speech decoder to synthesize aligned speech in any novel voice. We conduct thorough experiments on two datasets and demonstrate our method's generalization ability to unseen speakers. Our method achieves a 15.18% Word Error Rate (WER) on the USC-TIMIT MRI corpus, marking a huge improvement over the current state-of-the-art.}

To address this issue, we focus on learning phoneme-level alignments from paired whispers and text and employ a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system to synthesize the ground-truth. To reduce dependence on whispers, we learn phoneme alignments directly from NAMs, though the quality is constrained by the available training data. To further mitigate reliance on NAM/whisper data for ground-truth simulation, we propose incorporating the lip modality to infer speech and introduce a novel diffusion-based method that leverages recent advancements in lip-to-speech technology. Additionally, we release the MultiNAM dataset with over 7.96 hours of paired NAM, whisper, video, and text data from two speakers and benchmark all methods on this dataset.}

Traditional methods, which rely on phoneme sequence manipulation, are often cumbersome and error-prone. To address this, we propose Prompt-to-Correct, an editing-based methodology for pronunciation correction in TTS systems using voice prompts. Our approach enables ac- curate, granular corrections at test-time without the need for additional training or fine-tuning. Unlike existing speech edit- ing methods, we eliminate the need for external alignment to determine edit boundaries. By simply providing a correctly- pronounced reading of a word in any voice or accent, our system successfully corrects mispronunciations while maintaining continuity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional baselines and state-of-the-art speech editing techniques.}

From the static camera feed, EditIQ  initially generates multiple virtual feeds, emulating a team of cameramen. These virtual camera shots termed rushes are subsequently assembled using an automated editing algorithm, whose objective is to present the viewer with the most vivid scene content. To understand key scene elements and guide the editing process, we employ a two-pronged approach: (1) a large language model (LLM)-based dialogue understanding module to analyze conversational flow, coupled with (2) visual saliency prediction to identify meaningful scene elements and camera shots therefrom. We then formulate cinematic video editing as an energy minimization problem over shot selection, where cinematic constraints determine shot choices, transitions, and continuity. EditIQ  synthesizes an aesthetically and visually compelling representation of the original narrative while maintaining cinematic coherence and a smooth viewing experience. Efficacy of EditIQ  against competing baselines is demonstrated via a psychophysical study involving twenty participants on the BBC Old School dataset plus eleven theatre performance videos.

The novelty of our framework lies in the overall design, simulation of the ground-truth speech, and a sequence-to-sequence translation network, which works in the latent space. We present comprehensive experiments on the existing CSTR NAM TIMIT Plus corpus and our proposed StethoText: a large-scale synchronized database of non-audible murmur and text for speech research.

Prior work has identified annotation differences, especially for mention detection, as one of the main reasons for the generalization gap and proposed using additional annotated target domain data. Rather than relying on this additional annotation, we propose an alternative formulation of the CR task, Major Entity Identification (MEI), where we: (a) assume the target entities to be specified in the input, and (b) limit the task to only the frequent entities. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MEI models generalize well across domains on multiple datasets with supervised models and LLM-based few-shot prompting. Additionally, the MEI task fits the classification framework, which enables the use of classification-based metrics that are more robust than the current CR metrics. Finally, MEI is also of practical use as it allows a user to search for all mentions of a particular entity or a group of entities of interest}

Fine-grained classification can be challenging, mainly due to the requirement of knowledge or domain expertise for accurate annotation.

To this end, we present a novel approach for Post-Hoc Correction called Hierarchical Ensembles (HiE) that utilizes label hierarchy to improve the performance of fine-grained classification at test-time using the coarse-grained predictions. By only requiring the parents of leaf nodes, our method significantly reduces avg. mistake severity while improving top-1 accuracy on the iNaturalist-19 and tieredImageNet-H datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art on both benchmarks. We also investigate the efficacy of our approach in the semi-supervised setting. Our approach brings notable gains in top-1 accuracy while significantly decreasing the severity of mistakes as training data decreases for the fine-grained classes. The simplicity and post-hoc nature of HiE render it practical to be used with any off-the-shelf trained model to improve its predictions further.}

Our analysis on ten diverse saliency datasets suggests that none of the methods worked for incorporating audio.

With thorough experimental studies, we show that the proposed method improves over the prior art in accurately emulating the desired emotions while retaining the naturalness of speech. We extend the traditional evaluation of using individual sentences for a more complete evaluation of HCI systems. We present a novel experimental setup by replacing an actor with a TTS system in offline and live conversations. The emotion to be rendered is either predicted or manually assigned.

To solve RIS efficiently, we need to understand each word's relationship with other words, each region in the image to other regions, and cross-modal alignment between linguistic and visual domains. Recent methods model these three types of interactions sequentially. We argue that such a modular approach limits these methods' performance, and joint simultaneous reasoning can help resolve ambiguities. To this end, we propose a Joint Reasoning (JRM) module and a novel Cross-Modal Multi-Level Fusion (CMMLF) module for tackling this task. JRM effectively models the referent's multi-modal context by jointly reasoning over visual and linguistic modalities (performing word-word, image region-region, word-region interactions in a single module). CMMLF module further refines the segmentation masks by exchanging contextual information across visual hierarchy through linguistic features acting as a bridge. We present thorough ablation studies and validate our approach's performance on four benchmark datasets, and show that the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on all four datasets by significant margins.}

abstract = {Humans have a natural ability to effortlessly comprehend linguistic commands such as “park next to the yellow sedan” and instinctively know which region of the road the vehicle should navigate. Extending this ability to autonomous vehicles is the next step towards creating fully autonomous agents that respond and act according to human commands. To this end, we propose the novel task of Referring Navigable Regions (RNR), i.e., grounding regions of interest for navigation based on the linguistic command. RNR is different from Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), which focuses on grounding an object referred to by the natural language expression instead of grounding a navigable region. For example, for a command “park next to the yellow sedan,” RIS will aim to segment the referred sedan, and RNR aims to segment the suggested parking region on the road. We introduce a new dataset, Talk2Car-RegSeg, which extends the existing Talk2car [1] dataset with segmentation masks for the regions described by the linguistic commands. A separate test split with concise manoeuvre-oriented commands is provided to assess the practicality of our dataset. We benchmark the proposed dataset using a novel transformer-based architecture. We present extensive ablations and show superior performance over baselines on multiple evaluation metrics. A downstream path planner generating trajectories based on RNR outputs confirms the efficacy of the proposed framework.}

abstract = {We propose the ViNet architecture for audio-visual saliency prediction. ViNet is a fully convolutional encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder uses visual features from a network trained for action recognition, and the decoder infers a saliency map via trilinear interpolation and 3D convolutions, combining features from multiple hierarchies. The overall architecture of ViNet is conceptually simple; it is causal and runs in real-time (60 fps). ViNet does not use audio as input and still outperforms the state-of-the-art audio-visual saliency prediction models on nine different datasets (three visual-only and six audio-visual datasets). ViNet also surpasses human performance on the CC, SIM and AUC metrics for the AVE dataset, and to our knowledge, it is the first network to do so. We also explore a variation of ViNet architecture by augmenting audio features into the decoder. To our surprise, upon sufficient training, the network becomes agnostic to the input audio and provides the same output irrespective of the input. Interestingly, we also observe similar behaviour in the previous state-of-the-art models \cite{tsiami2020stavis} for audio-visual saliency prediction. Our findings contrast with previous works on deep learning-based audio-visual saliency prediction, suggesting a clear avenue for future explorations incorporating audio in a more effective manner.

Current text to speech systems generates speech with either a flat emotion, emotion selected from a predefined set, average variation learned from prosody sequences in training data or transferred from a source style. We propose a text to speech(TTS) system, where a user can choose the emotion of generated speech from a continuous and meaningful emotion space (Arousal-Valence space). The proposed TTS system can generate speech from the text in any speaker's style, with fine control of emotion. We show that the system works on emotion unseen during training and can scale to previously unseen speakers given his/her speech sample. Our work expands the horizon of the state-of-the-art FastSpeech2 backbone to a multi-speaker setting and gives it much-coveted continuous (and interpretable) affective control, without any observable degradation in the quality of the synthesized speech.}

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate a constrained formulation of neural networks where the output is a convex function of the input. We show that the convexity constraints can be enforced on both fully connected and convolutional layers, making them applicable to most architectures. The convexity constraints include restricting the weights (for all but the first layer) to be non-negative and using a non-decreasing convex activation function. Albeit simple, these constraints have profound implications on the generalization abilities of the network. We draw three valuable insights: (a) Input Output Convex Networks (IOC-NN) self regularize and almost uproot the problem of overfitting; (b) Although heavily constrained, they come close to the performance of the base architectures; and (c) The ensemble of convex networks can match or outperform the non convex counterparts. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed idea using thorough experiments and ablation studies on MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets with three different neural network architectures.

abstract = {There has been increasing interest in building deep hierarchy-aware classifiers, aiming to quantify and reduce the severity of mistakes and not just count the number of errors. The idea is to exploit the label hierarchy (e.g., WordNet ontology) and consider graph distances as a proxy for mistake severity. Surprisingly, on examining mistake-severity distributions of the top-1 prediction, we find that current state-of-the-art hierarchy-aware deep classifiers do not show practical improvement in making better mistakes than the standard cross-entropy baseline. In fact, they reduce the average mistake-severity metric by largely making additional low-severity or easily avoidable mistakes. This might explain the noticeable accuracy drop. To this end, we resort to the classical Conditional Risk Minimization (CRM) framework for hierarchy aware classification. Given a cost matrix and a reliable estimate of likelihoods (obtained from a trained network), CRM simply amends mistakes at inference time; it needs no extra parameters; it requires adding just one line of code to the standard cross-entropy baseline. It significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art and consistently obtains large reductions in the average hierarchical distance of top-k predictions across datasets, with very little loss in accuracy. Since CRM does not require retraining or fine-tuning of any hyperparameter, it can be used with any off-the-shelf cross-entropy trained model.}

abstract = {Multi-object tracking has seen a lot of progress recently, albeit with substantial annotation costs for developing better and larger labeled datasets. In this work, we remove the need for annotated datasets by proposing an unsupervised re-identification network, thus sidestepping the labeling costs entirely, required for training. Given unlabeled videos, our proposed method (SimpleReID) first generates tracking labels using SORT and trains a ReID network to predict the generated labels using crossentropy loss. We demonstrate that SimpleReID performs substantially better than simpler alternatives, and we recover the full performance of its supervised counterpart consistently across diverse tracking frameworks. The observations are unusual because unsupervised ReID is not expected to excel in crowded scenarios with occlusions, and drastic viewpoint changes. By incorporating our unsupervised SimpleReID with CenterTrack trained on augmented still images, we establish a new state-of-the-art performance on popular datasets like MOT16/17 without using tracking supervision, beating current best (CenterTrack) by 0.2-0.3 MOTA and 4.4-4.8 IDF1 scores. We further provide evidence for limited scope for improvement in IDF1 scores beyond our unsupervised ReID in the studied settings. Our investigation suggests reconsideration towards more sophisticated, supervised, end-to-end trackers by showing promise in simpler unsupervised alternatives.}

In this paper, we present a method to reliably detect such obstacles through a multi-modal framework of sparse LiDAR(VLP-16) and Monocular vision. LiDAR is employed to provide additional context in the form of confidence maps to monocular segmentation networks. We show significant performance gains when the context is fed as an additional input to monocular semantic segmentation frameworks. We further present a new semantic segmentation dataset to the community, comprising of over 3000 image frames with corresponding LiDAR observations. The images come with pixel-wise annotations of three classes off-road, road, and small obstacle. We stress that precise calibration between LiDAR and camera is crucial for this task and thus propose a novel Hausdorff distance based calibration refinement method over extrinsic parameters. As a first benchmark over this dataset, we report our results with 73% instance detection up to a distance of 50 meters on challenging scenarios. Qualitatively by showcasing accurate segmentation of obstacles less than 15 cms at 50m depth and quantitatively through favourable comparisons vis a vis prior art, we vindicate the method's efficacy.

abstract = {Learning computational models for visual attention (saliency estimation) is an effort to inch machines/robots closer to human visual cognitive abilities. Data-driven efforts have dominated the landscape since the introduction of deep neural network architectures. In deep learning research, the choices in architecture design are often empirical and frequently lead to more complex models than necessary. The complexity, in turn, hinders the application requirements. In this paper, we identify four key components of saliency models, i.e., input features, multi-level integration, readout architecture, and loss functions. We review the existing state of the art models on these four components and propose novel and simpler alternatives. As a result, we propose two novel end-to-end architectures called SimpleNet and MDNSal, which are neater, minimal, more interpretable and achieve state of the art performance on public saliency benchmarks. SimpleNet is an optimized encoder-decoder architecture and brings notable performance gains on the SALICON dataset (the largest saliency benchmark). MDNSal is a parametric model that directly predicts parameters of a GMM distribution and is aimed to bring more interpretability to the prediction maps. The proposed saliency models can be inferred at 25fps, making them suitable for real-time applications. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/samyak0210/saliency}

Given the original video, scene content and user eye-gaze tracks are combined to generate an edited video comprising cinematically valid actor shots and shot transitions to generate an aesthetic and vivid representation of the original narrative. We model cinematic video editing as an energy minimization problem over shot selection, whose constraints capture cinematographic editing conventions. Gazed scene locations primarily determine the shots constituting the edited video. Effectiveness of GAZED against multiple competing methods is demonstrated via a psychophysical study involving 12 users and twelve performance videos.}

More specifically, (a) we test re-detection capability of the trackers in the wild by simulating virtual cuts, (b) we investigate the role of chance in the recovery of tracker after failure and (c) we propose a novel metric allowing visual inference on the ability of a tracker to track contiguously (without any failure) at a given accuracy.

This paper presents a novel formulation for online and real-time estimation of smooth camera trajectories. Many works have focused on global optimization of the trajectory to produce an offline output. Some recent works have tried to extend this to the online setting, but lack either in the quality of the camera trajectories or need large labeled datasets to train their supervised model. We propose two models, one a convex optimization based approach and another a CNN based model, both of which can exploit the temporal trends in the camera behavior. Our model is built in an unsupervised way without any ground truth trajectories and is robust to noisy outliers. We evaluate our models on two different settings namely a basketball dataset and a stage performance dataset and compare against multiple baselines and past approaches. Our models outperform other methods on quantitative and qualitative metrics and produce smooth camera trajectories that are motivated by cinematographic principles. These models can also be easily adopted to run in real-time with a low computational cost, making them fit for a variety of applications.}

The pipeline precludes the need for a prior registered map through a local waypoint generator neural network. The waypoint generator network (WGN) maps semantics and natural language encodings (NLE) to local waypoints. A local planner then generates a trajectory from the ego location of the vehicle (an outdoor car in this case) to these locally generated waypoints while a low-level controller executes these plans faithfully. The efficacy of the pipeline is verified in the CARLA simulator environment as well as on local semantic maps built from real-world KITTI dataset. In both these environments (simulated and real-world) we show the ability of the WGN to generate waypoints accurately by mapping NLE of varying sequence lengths and levels of complexity. We compare with baseline approaches and show significant performance gain over them. And finally, we show real implementations on our electric car verifying that the pipeline lends itself to practical and tangible realizations in uncontrolled outdoor settings. In loop execution of the proposed pipeline that involves repetitive invocations of the network is critical for any such language-based navigation framework. This effort successfully accomplishes this thereby bypassing the need for prior metric maps or strategies for metric level localization during traversal.}

Annotating ground truth head pose angles for images in the wild is difficult and requires ad-hoc fitting procedures (which provides only coarse and approximate annotations). This highlights the need for approaches which can train on data captured in controlled environment and generalize on the images in the wild (with varying appearance and illumination of the face). Most present day deep learning approaches which learn a regression function directly on the input images fail to do so. To this end, we propose to use a higher level representation to regress the head pose while using deep learning architectures. More specifically, we use the uncertainty maps in the form of 2D soft localization heatmap images over five facial keypoints, namely left ear, right ear, left eye, right eye and nose, and pass them through an convolutional neural network to regress the head-pose. We show head pose estimation results on two challenging benchmarks BIWI and AFLW and our approach surpasses the state of the art on both the datasets.}

We benchmark the dataset on 17 state of the art trackers and rank them according to tracking accuracy and run time speeds. We further categorize the test sequences with different attributes and present a thorough quantitative and qualitative evaluation. Our most interesting observations are (a) existing short sequence benchmarks fail to bring out the inherent differences in tracking algorithms which widen up while tracking on long sequences and (b) the accuracy of most trackers abruptly drops on challenging long sequences, suggesting the potential need of research efforts in the direction of long term tracking.},

Our algorithm performs editing with cut, pan and zoom operations by optimizing the path of a cropping window within the original video while seeking to (i) preserve salient regions, and (ii) adhere to the principles of cinematography. Our approach is (a) content agnostic as the same methodology is employed to re-edit a wide-angle video recording or a close-up movie sequence captured with a static or moving camera, and (b) independent of video length and can in principle re-edit an entire movie in one shot. Our algorithm consists of two steps. The first step employs gaze transition cues to detect time stamps where new cuts are to be introduced in the original video via dynamic programming. A subsequent step optimizes the cropping window path (to create pan and zoom effects), while accounting for the original and new cuts. The cropping window path is designed to include maximum gaze information, and is composed of piecewise constant, linear and parabolic segments. It is obtained via L(1) regularized convex optimization which ensures a smooth viewing experience. We test our approach on a wide variety of videos and demonstrate significant improvement over the state-of-the-art, both in terms of computational complexity and qualitative aspects. A study performed with 16 users confirms that our approach results in a superior viewing experience as compared to gaze driven re-editing [JSSH15] and letterboxing methods, especially for wide-angle static camera recordings.}

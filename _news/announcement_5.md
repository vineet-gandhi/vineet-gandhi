Congratulations to [Kawshik](https://kawshikmanikantan.github.io/) on successfully defending his thesis and completing his Dual Degree. Though NLP isn't my core area, I ended up working on it with him, it was challenging but rewarding. Big thanks to Makarand and Shubham, for playing a crucial role in his thesis work. Best wishes to Kawshik for his next chapter at Google DeepMind.
